## Add to Cart Rate measures how many visitors show buying intent by adding products to their cart.

## If Add to Cart actions increase, it means product appeal, pricing, or landing page quality improved.

## If sessions increase but add-to-cart does not increase proportionally, the rate decreases — meaning visitors are not interested enough in the products.

## 👉 This metric reflects product attractiveness and merchandising strength.
