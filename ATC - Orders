# Cart Abandonment Rate ((ATC - Orders) / ATC)
## Cart Abandonment measures how many users drop off after adding products to their cart.
## If the number of abandoned carts increases, it directly reduces orders and revenue.
## If add-to-cart increases but orders do not, abandonment increases — meaning friction in checkout, payment issues, or unexpected charges.
## 👉 Lower cart abandonment means smoother checkout and higher revenue realization.
