Revenue per Visitor (Revenue / Sessions)

## Revenue per Visitor shows how much money each website visit generates on average.

## If revenue increases while sessions remain stable, RPV increases — meaning better monetization through higher AOV or better conversion.

## If sessions increase but revenue does not grow proportionally, RPV decreases — indicating weak traffic quality.

## 👉 This is a powerful combined metric because it reflects both conversion rate and order value efficiency.
