1) Not all cards are equal
Premium & international cards silently destroy margin.

2) Refunds are never free
MDR + auth fees are sunk cost.

3)Success rate optimization reduces cost
More retries = more fees.

4)Settlement speed is a finance decision, not tech
Faster settlement = hidden interest.

5)Payment mix is a profit lever
UPI ≠ Card ≠ Wallet ≠ BNPL (huge cost difference).
